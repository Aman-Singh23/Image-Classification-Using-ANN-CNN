# Image Classification Using ANN & CNN
A model which classify different categories of images.

### ANN : Artifical Neural Networks

## ANN and CNN for Image Classification

With ANN, concrete data points must be provided. For example, in a model where we are trying to distinguish between dogs and cats, the width of the noses and length of the ears must be explicitly provided as data points.

When using CNN, these spatial features are extracted from image input. This makes CNN ideal when thousands of features need to be extracted. Instead of having to measure each individual feature, CNN gathers these features on its own.

Using ANN, image classification problems become difficult because 2-dimensional images need to be converted to 1-dimensional vectors. This increases the number of trainable parameters exponentially. Increasing trainable parameters takes storage and processing capability.

In other words, it would be expensive. Compared to its predecessors, the main advantage of CNN is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. This is why CNN would be an ideal solution to computer vision and image classification problems.

### By comparing both ANN and CNN model...
We come to know that CNN is much better than ANN for classifying images
